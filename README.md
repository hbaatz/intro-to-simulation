This repo contains the implementation of an [interactive-website-tutorial](https://hbaatz.github.io/intro-to-simulation/) on physics simulation (using the forward euler method). The intended audience is highschool students and it is currently only localized in German. The website is build with [SvelteKit](https://svelte.dev/) and [threlte](https://threlte.xyz/) by [Fabian](https://github.com/Fabiano197) and [me](https://github.com/hbaatz).

# Setup
Install the development environment under [node.js](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) via
`npm install`.

# Dev Server
To run a local version of the website use
`npm run dev`.

# Deployment
We currently deploy the website as a github-pages site via CI to [hbaatz.github.io/intro-to-simulation](https://hbaatz.github.io/intro-to-simulation/).
